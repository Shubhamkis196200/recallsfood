# Urgent: Chicken Products Recalled Due to Salmonella Risk

The USDA has issued a Class I recall affecting approximately 4.2 million pounds of frozen chicken products manufactured by Heritage Farms. The recall was initiated after routine FSIS testing detected Salmonella Enteritidis in samples collected from retail locations.

The contamination was first identified during a random sampling program at a Walmart location in Ohio on January 28, 2026. Subsequent testing confirmed the presence of Salmonella in multiple lots produced between October 2025 and January 2026.

Consumers who have purchased these products are urged to check their freezers immediately and either discard the affected products or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.
