# How to Check if Your Food Has Been Recalled

Food recalls happen more often than you might think — over 300 in 2025 alone. Here are three reliable ways to check if anything in your kitchen has been recalled.

## Method 1: Check FDA and USDA Websites Directly
The FDA maintains a searchable database at FDA.gov/recalls. The USDA's FSIS publishes meat and poultry recalls at fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

## Method 2: Sign Up for Email Alerts
Both the FDA and USDA offer free email notification services at FoodSafety.gov.

## Method 3: Use RecallsFood.com
We aggregate recalls from both agencies, add plain-English explanations, and make it easy to search by product, brand, or store.
